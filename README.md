# rive-followmouse-outside-canvas
This is a template to show you how to follow the mouse position outside of the canvas.
It also works if you resize the canvas. You can test it by uncommenting this part of the css code:

  ```css
  /* Uncomment this if you want the canvas to resize
  /* width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh; */
```
